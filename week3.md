Content Insights

Website Content Insights 

Wordpress themes are a great way to get a head start on building and styling a website on wordpress. I used the 2024 template but utilised child themes to alter the original. 
Child themes basically allow you to change an existing themes aspects whithout changing the entire entity. So for example for different paragraph colors in 
different blocks I used child theme styling to alter the background-color from white to black so it could easily be seen. The site editor in wordpress while 
confusing is simple enough to get the hang of after a little time spent working. Importing content is made simple with the block paragraph as you can copy content and images from 
Joomla and paste them in new pages in wordpress. I found Wordpress to be much more beginner friend as apposed to Joomla due to the simple editor already pre built into the back end. 

Classmate activity insights

Career 

Employability

Based on the inclass activity I believe my employability skills have been enhanced. During the exercise I was exposed to both being and interviewee and interviewing. I was also able to identify strengths and weaknesses of fellow classmates and was able to identify potential teammates from this. I believe this and 
my new found wordpress skills which I picked up through independent learning searching will make my employabiliy much better.
