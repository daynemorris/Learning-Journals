## Estimated Hours

Around 5 hours (3 hour research, 2 hours implementation)

## Content Insights

While watching all the relevent content materials I learnt various different skills about Joomla. Here are all off the skill I have learnt form the content:

Categories can be used to help struture a joomla site. You can use an about category to link a main menu item to an article or a cluster of articles within a category. 
Themes within Joomla can be easily editied within styles in the joomla backend settings. But you cannot change core aspects of the theme from this menu. 
Modules are great way to struture the Joomla site. Modules are like building blocks you can moves to different levels of the website. For example for the cassopedia theme I moved the menu bar to the top bar position to make the website more convential. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In Joomla I have learnt how to edit the structure and content of a site. I believe that CMS site building is very useful skill for the IT industry and is a very employable value. A learning insight that I have made is that by learning through independent searching and researching I was able to build the skills to edit and refine a joomla site on a very basic level. It is also very interesting learning about backend developing. My friend micheal, who is now a software developer talked about Joomlaaa front and backend. I now understand how and why backend is needed in a site and I believe that I will definitely need the skills I learnt this week in my future IT endevours.
