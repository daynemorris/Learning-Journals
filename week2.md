Learning Activities & Resources

This week I created a best betting odds start up for punters using the integrated Joomla CMS template and environment. These are the links I used for 
learning:

In addition to the linked-in Tutorials I had to seek articles like this to find more information about things I did not understand:

Estimated Hours

Around 5 hours (3 hour research, 2 hours implementation)

Content Insights

Initially Joomla was a little confusing considering the first screen I was greeted by was cloundaccess.net page. But after some guided learning everything became clear. 
I also found the more I used the service I under stood each bit more and more. The Linked in videos were very informative and easy to watch. However, beacuse the lady
in the video was generating a blog website about plants, in some areas it was hard to apply so it was hard to know where and what to watch. 

Career/Employability/Learning Insights

After the completion I think I developed a relatively good grasp of how a CMS works and why they are needed. In this day and age it seems as simple as ever. I can see the 
definite need for these skills in the IT industry as it helps make professional and industry standard websites. Some learning insights I found were that by conducting independet learning, I was able to learn faster and find solutions to problems that actually apply to my subject matter.
