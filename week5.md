## Content Insights

Child themes are essentially themes that inherit all the styles from an existing theme (main theme) and allow you to change aspects without altering the original.
A child theme consists of one style.css file and one functions.php file, which you can make changes to. In the header of the child theme, you need to specify all the qualities of the theme, such as the main theme and the name of the child theme.

The reason child themes are used is that customization can be easily preserved. If you were to work directly with a parent theme, making changes, and an update were to come, it could overwrite your work.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Many industry standard web developers utilise child themes as they can make changes to their site without risk of loss and changing the entire template.
I understand how and why they are used but I do not see a point to using them for my career pathway. 
As I see it right now, my application of CMS's in my future career will be to redesign or create sites for buisnesses which I could just edit the main theme. 
But in saying this, If I were to work in environment where there 
was a pre existing child theme it is a good tool to have knowing how to edit and manage a child theme.
