# Week 10
## Learning Activities & Resources

Referred to Task sheet for rubric:   
CP3402-2024-1-Project.pdf

Estimated hours
Around 2 hours (1 hour recording each persons part, 1 hour peer reviewing) 

## Content Insights
By running through each person's recordings twice, we were able to effectively mark and improve our presentation delivery. Using the task sheet's rubric was helpful in advising teammates on what they should improve during their 1-2 minute recording. The most common error made by group members when recording was stuttering. This was expected as it took time to learn our scripts and refine the content we were saying that wasn't really necessary. The best speaker in our group was Shivuan, which was expected as she has had quite a decent amount of public speaking experience. By doing this activity, I re-learned how to make and rehearse a script. It was important to have a few takes to get the wording and pronunciation of what I was saying correct.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
It's pretty obvious why this practical specifically is a great tool to have under my belt for my career. By learning how to speak in front of my group and create a video explaining our workflow is vital in the IT industry as nowadays, everything is online or video-based. I believe that by honing my speaking and video creation skills it boosts my employability tenfold. A learning insight I made was that teammates would not tell me the things I was doing wrong (in fear of hurting my feelings), so I asked them to be honest. After doing this, they ripped my presentation to shreds and in the process, I learned how to become better at speaking.
