# Week 10
## Learning Activities & Resources

Referred to Task sheet for rubric:   
CP3402-2024-1-Project.pdf

Estimated hours
Around 2 hours (1 hour recording each persons part, 1 hour peer reviewing) 

## Content Insights
By running through each persons recordings 2 times we were able to effectively mark and improve upon our presentation delivery. Using the task sheet's rubic was useful in advising teammates on what they should improve upon during their 1-2 minute recording. The most common error made by group members when recording was stuttering. This is expected as it took time to learn our scripts and fix the content we where saying that wasn't really needed. The best speaker in our group was shivuan, which was expected as she has had quite a decent amount of public speaking experience. 


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Sass is a widely used industry standard for web development, and I believe that by acquiring skills in this preprocessor language, I have increased my employability. I definitely see myself using Sass in my future career path, as I aspire to pursue either site building or site management. One insight I gained while coding in SCSS is that it significantly simplifies the task of making changes in code. For example, while coding for my group, someone might complain that the header is not centered. All I had to do was open the header file and make some straightforward changes to the code. Another insight I discovered is that when I was stuck not understanding a certain part of SCSS, such as mixins, I could easily ask a generative AI to explain the process and how to use it, thereby improving my understanding of the subject.
