## Content Insights
Hosting through, php 8 usbwebserver allows for website designers to easily local host their wordpress site. Its as simple as generating a database using phpMyadmin and copying base code from wordpress
to generated a locally hosted site. And I can definitely see the advantages of this from my learning, speed, better security and better backups to name a few. A local host basically allows you to do anything you like 
to your website without the limitations of a hosting service. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
As its my understanding that local hosts improve the testability of a site, this would be incredibly useful when it comes to my potential career skills. Being able to setup and use a local host with a dedicated database 
allows alot more interactivity with the raw site and is definitely an employable skill for clients who like changing aspects of a site. My learning insights, which were developed by conducting self driven learning, 
is that local hosting is a very useful skill which allows a backed up version of site which makes testing and editing alot quicker than traditional online hosting. I can see many use cases for local hosting and do believe it
is an attractive skill to have.
