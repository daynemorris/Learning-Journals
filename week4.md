My Interview Questions:
What are your strengths when it comes group work What is your preferred communication method when meeting in a group When do you do the majority of your work

Content Insights
Website Content Insights
WordPress themes provide a fantastic head start for building and styling a website on the platform. I leveraged the 2024 template but utilized child themes to personalize it without modifying the original files.

Child themes essentially allow you to customize specific aspects of an existing theme without affecting the core files. For example, I achieved different paragraph colors in different blocks by using child theme tyling to change the background-color from white to black, enhancing their visibility.

While the WordPress site editor may initially appear confusing, it becomes quite straightforward after a brief period of familiarization. Importing content is facilitated by the block paragraph feature, which allows you to copy content and images from Joomla and paste them directly into new WordPress pages. Overall, I found WordPress significantly more beginner-friendly than Joomla due to its simple, built-in editor in the backend.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
his week has equipped me with valuable skills in learning WordPress site functions. Child themes and page block editing will be helpful in generating a WordPress site for myself or future employers.

In terms of career insights, I believe that exposure to WordPress and its backend management makes me more employable. The in-class activity has certainly enhanced my employability skills.

During the exercise, I participated in both interviewer and interviewee roles. This allowed me to identify strengths and weaknesses in myself and my classmates, highlighting potential teammates for future collaborations.

One key learning insight is the importance of online research when encountering difficulties. For example, when I needed to insert an image within a table, a quick Google search led me to the solution of adding custom CSS. I believe my newly acquired skills in child themes and page management will make me a more employable and desirable teammate, capable of researching and adapting my knowledge to various situations.

Classmate activity insights
During my interactions with classmates, I discovered compatibility with certain teammates. Two out of the three I spoke with appeared to be particularly strong matches.

Both of them prefer a dominant face-to-face meeting schedule with an online backup session if the initial meeting is missed. I believe this approach is beneficial as face-to-face interaction can foster better team motivation.

Additionally, they identify their strengths as initiative within a group, either assuming leadership roles or assisting in leadership. This complements my preference for taking a hands-on worker role to complete tasks efficiently.

While the last teammate shared some core values, they were undecided about their preferred meeting schedule. Their preference for a hybrid approach is not inherently problematic, but I have observed that some individuals tend to lose focus in such arrangements.
