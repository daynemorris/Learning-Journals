Week 1 

Learning Activities & Resources

This week I created a best betting odds start up for punters to use to find the best possible odds to gamble. I used a few linkedIn learning resources to refresh my HTML knowledged and revisted the web design subject from last semester to remember how to site host. I also used some coded examples to create a nav bar from w3schools.

Estimated Hours

Around 4 hours (2 hour research, 2 hours implementation)

Content Insights

Betify was a good starter website to make as it refreshed my learning from web design and development. I also learnt that having a simple website that simple works and can be
published is much better than spending hours on website that is not feasible. I feel a bit more confident in building my own website from the ground up with HTML and CSS. 

Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Upon completion of this practical, I learnt that there is much more than just creating a website than just making some HTML and CSS. There is a need for web hosting which is costly if you do not have capital. I also learnt some more advanded CSS techniques provided by w3schools and linkedIn tutorials which helped me make my web pages more professional and useable.
