## Estimated hours
Around 4 hours (1 hour reading, 3 hours implementing and discussing with group)

## Content Insights
Integration is a key tool to have when setting up collaboration with a team. I learned by simulatanouesly having changes made in the GitHub README files show up on Trello it allows for not only connectivity but better backup. LinkedIn is a great professional 
tool which connects employers and collegues to each other and by linking with my group it allows for better communication between the team and the outside world.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
A learning insight I made is that by being face to face it allowed our group to work well this week and should be replicated moving forward. Also by learning how to communicate across different integrated methods, I believe it increased my employability as an
IT professional as well as gave me a look at work inside a potential career. Bouncing ideas off each teammate to find the best possible solution and way to overcome issues leads me to believe I have the people skills and perserverance required.
