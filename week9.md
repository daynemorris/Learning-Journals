## Content Insights
Sass is an amazing preprocessing tool for CSS. It can be used to store and utilize variables as needed, nest rules, incorporate mixins, utilize functions, and support inheritance. Essentially, it is a very Pythonic version of CSS that is processed and compiled into CSS. I found Sass to be both simple and complex simultaneously. As a third-year IT student, concepts such as functions and variables felt familiar to me. While Sass is a great tool for building styling for your website, the fact that browsers do not understand the language makes it heavily reliant on compilation. This is why another program, such as Gulp, is required to automate the compilation of a SCSS file.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
PHP is a widely used programming language employed by numerous websites and CMS services. By acquiring skills and knowledge in PHP, not only does it enhance my employability, but also my proficiency as an IT career professional. One insight I've gained is that PHP bears a striking resemblance to Python. I found it easy to grasp the layout and format of echoes and if/else statements by leveraging the knowledge I've accrued from Python. I am confident that in the future, whether it involves crafting login forms or establishing connections with CMS databases via MySQL, I will leverage the PHP skills I've developed.
