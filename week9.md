Sass is an amazing preprocessing tool before css. It can be used to store and add variables as their needed, nest rules, add mixins, have funcitons and support inheritance. Its basically a very pythonic version of CSS which is processed and compiled to CSS. 

## Content Insights
An Apache web server facilitates the delivery of web content over the internet. It provides a platform to test and modify PHP code, which functions as an extension of HTML. PHP enables a range of functions including the creation of dynamic page content, gathering form data, handling cookies and sessions, and connecting to databases. Being a server-side programming language, PHP operations occur on the server rather than being visible in the source code of webpages accessed by users.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
PHP is a widely used programming language employed by numerous websites and CMS services. By acquiring skills and knowledge in PHP, not only does it enhance my employability, but also my proficiency as an IT career professional. One insight I've gained is that PHP bears a striking resemblance to Python. I found it easy to grasp the layout and format of echoes and if/else statements by leveraging the knowledge I've accrued from Python. I am confident that in the future, whether it involves crafting login forms or establishing connections with CMS databases via MySQL, I will leverage the PHP skills I've developed.
