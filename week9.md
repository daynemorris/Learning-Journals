## Content Insights
Sass is an amazing preprocessing tool for CSS. It can be used to store and utilize variables as needed, nest rules, incorporate mixins, utilize functions, and support inheritance. Essentially, it is a very Pythonic version of CSS that is processed and compiled into CSS. I found Sass to be both simple and complex simultaneously. As a third-year IT student, concepts such as functions and variables felt familiar to me. While Sass is a great tool for building styling for your website, the fact that browsers do not understand the language makes it heavily reliant on compilation. This is why another program, such as Gulp, is required to automate the compilation of a SCSS file.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Sass is a widely used industry standard for web development, and I believe that by acquiring skills in this preprocessor language, I have increased my employability. I definitely see myself using Sass in my future career path, as I aspire to pursue either site building or site management. One insight I gained while coding in SCSS is that it significantly simplifies the task of making changes in code. For example, while coding for my group, someone might complain that the header is not centered. All I had to do was open the header file and make some straightforward changes to the code. Another insight I discovered is that when I was stuck not understanding a certain part of SCSS, such as mixins, I could easily ask a generative AI to explain the process and how to use it, thereby improving my understanding of the subject.
