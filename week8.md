# Learning Experiment

## Learning Activity Experiment: 
Exploring the effectiveness of YouTube Tutorials to strengthen knowledge in Theme Development 

## Hypothesis:

Throughout the duration of this course I have been employing the same techniques of learning through LinkedIn and demo videos. I hypothesize that if I instead watch YouTube videos around the topic it will improve my knowledge in the subject area. My theory is that if I enjoy learning about the content through my own means it will increase how much information I retain.  

## Test: 

To test this hypothesis, I will employ the following approach:


### Pre-Assessment:
- Before watching any Youtube videos, I will assess my current knowledge and skills gained from the provided practical work. This could entail attempting to create a basic custom theme from scratch using underscores. Documenting time taken, any errors or challenges that occured during the problem solving process.

### Learning Activity: 
- Over the course of a week, I will spend 20-30 minutes to watching YouTube videos around custom themes and testing themes as videos walk me through the process.

### Post-Assessment:
- At the end of the week near the time of writing this document I will reassess my knowledge in creating, editing and building custom themes using underscores. I will once again document the time taken and any hardships experienced during the activity.
