# Learning Experiment

## Learning Activity Experiment: Exploring the effectiveness of YouTube Tutorials to strengthen knowledge in Theme Development 

## Hypothesis:

Throughout the duration of this course I have been employing the same techniques of learning through LinkedIn and demo videos. I hypothesize that if I instead watch YouTube videos around the topic it will improve my knowledge in the subject area. My theory is that if I enjoy learning about the content through my own means it will increase how much information I retain.
