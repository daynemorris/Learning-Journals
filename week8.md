# Learning Activities

## Learning Activity Experiment: 
Exploring the effectiveness of YouTube Tutorials to strengthen knowledge in Theme Development 

## Hypothesis:

Throughout the duration of this course I have been employing the same techniques of learning through LinkedIn and demo videos. I hypothesize that if I instead watch YouTube videos around the topic it will improve my knowledge in the subject area. My theory is that if I enjoy learning about the content through my own means it will increase how much information I retain.  

## Test: 

To test this hypothesis, I will employ the following approach:

### Pre-Assessment:
- Before watching any Youtube videos, I will assess my current knowledge and skills gained from the provided practical work. This could entail attempting to create a basic custom theme from scratch using underscores. Documenting time taken, any errors or challenges that occured during the problem solving process.

### Learning Activity: 
- Over the course of a week, I will spend 20-30 minutes to watching YouTube videos around custom themes and testing themes as videos walk me through the process.

### Post-Assessment:
- At the end of the week near the time of writing this document I will reassess my knowledge in creating, editing and building custom themes using underscores. I will once again document the time taken and any hardships experienced during the activity. 

## Results:

Upon completing the Learning Experiment, the following results were observed:

I found that by wathcing Youtube tutorials/videos I was alot more engaged, had better time efficiency and retained more knowledge than the traditional practical resources. Because YouTube videos tend to have more or less a "non-professional" feel it was easier to engage with content from one web designer to another. I found the content alot more relatable and retain more knowledge than in the few LinkedIn video I watched on custom themes. This also improved by time efficiency as I usually just followed some of the walkthroughs and listened to the terms that these creators where saying. In summary, I believe that the learning acitivity of watching Youtube Tutorials helps significantly in the learning process.
